                Meditations is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made. The book is a collection of the private notes made by Marcus Aurelius, a great Roman Emperor and stoic philosopher, giving advice to himself on how to make good on the responsibilities and obligations of his positions. It was not intended to be read by others so his writings are an awesome insight into the mind and philosophy of the world's most powerful man at the time. His thoughts are practical and you can apply them straight away to improve your way of life.

                        <strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong> (26 April 121 – 17 March 180) was Roman
                        emperor from 8 March 161 to 17 March 180 and a Stoic
                        philosopher. He was the last of the rulers traditionally
                        known as the Five Good Emperors, and the last emperor of
                        the Pax Romana, an age of relative peace and stability
                        for the Roman Empire. He was also consul in 140, 145,
                        and 161.

                      <p>
                        Marcus Annius Verus was born in a prominent and
                        established family but nobody at the time would have
                        predicted that he would one day be Emperor of the
                        Empire. There is little that is known of his childhood
                        but he was a serious young man who also enjoyed
                        wrestling, boxing and hunting. Around his teenage years,
                        the reigning emperor at the time, Hadrian was nearing
                        death and was childless. He had to pick a successor and
                        after his first choice, Lucius Ceionius, died
                        unexpectedly, he chose Antoninus. He was a senator who
                        was also childless and he would have to adopt Marcus, as
                        per Hadrian’s condition, as well as Ceionius’s son,
                        Lucius Verus. This is how Marcus’s name changed to
                        Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. <hr />
                        Once Hadrian died, it was clear that Marcus was next in
                        line for the most important position in the empire. His
                        education would become of serious concern and he would
                        have the privilege of studying under Herodes Atticus, a
                        rhetorician from Athens (Marcus would later write his
                        Meditations in Greek) as well as Marcus Cornelius
                        Fronto, his instructor in Latin whose letters of
                        correspondence with Marcus survive to this day. Marcus
                        would also serve as a consul twice thus receiving a
                        valuable and practical education. <hr />
                        In 161, as Antoninus died and ended one of the longest
                        reigns, Marcus became the Emperor of the Roman Empire
                        and ruled for nearly two decades until his death in 180.
                        He also co-ruled in the beginning with Lucius Verus, his
                        adopted brother until Lucius’ death eight years later.
                        His reign wasn’t easy: wars with the Parthian Empire,
                        the barbarian tribes menacing the Empire on the northern
                        border, the rise of Christianity as well as the plague
                        that left numerous dead. <hr />
                        Marcus’s death came in 180 in his military headquarters
                        in modern day Vienna. The historian Cassius Dio
                        describes Marcus’s attitude towards his son, Commodus
                        who he made co-emperor few years earlier and was now to
                        succeed him: “[Marcus] was not strong in body and was
                        involved in a multitude of troubles throughout
                        practically his entire reign. But for my part, I admire
                        him all the more for this very reason, that amid unusual
                        and extraordinary difficulties he both survived himself
                        and preserved the empire. Just one thing prevented him
                        from being completely happy, namely, that after rearing
                        and educating his son in the best possible way he was
                        vastly disappointed in him.” <hr />
                        It is important to realize the gravity of that position
                        and the magnitude of power that Marcus possessed. He
                        held one of—if not the most—powerful positions in the
                        world at the time. If he chose to, nothing would be off
                        limits. He could indulge and succumb to temptations,
                        there was nobody that could restrain him from any of his
                        wishes. There is a reason the adage that power in
                        absolute absolutely corrupts has been repeated
                        throughout history—it unfortunately tends to be true.
                        And yet, as the essayist Matthew Arnold remarked, Marcus
                        proved himself worthy of the position he was in. <hr />
                        And it was not only him who offered that verdict. The
                        famous historian Edward Gibbon wrote that under Marcus,
                        the last of the ‘Five Good Emperors,’ “the Roman Empire
                        was governed by absolute power, under the guidance of
                        wisdom and virtue”. The guidance of wisdom and virtue.
                        That’s what separates Marcus from the majority of past
                        and present world leaders. Just think of the diary that
                        he left behind, which is now known as his Meditations
                        which we discuss below: the private thoughts of the most
                        powerful man in the world, admonishing himself on how to
                        be more virtuous, more just, more immune to temptation,
                        wiser. <hr />
                        And for Marcus, Stoicism provided a framework for
                        dealing with the stresses of daily life as a leader of
                        one of the most powerful empires in human history. It is
                        not surprising that he wrote his Meditations in the last
                        decade of his life, while on campaigning against foreign
                        invaders. Passed down from his mentors and teachers,
                        Marcus embraced the studies of Stoicism which we see in
                        him thanking his teacher Rusticus for introducing him to
                        Stoicism and Epictetus inside Meditations. Another
                        influence on Marcus came from Heraclitus, whose concepts
                        we can see throughout Meditations and who had a strong
                        influence on Stoic thought. Given the literary world at
                        the time, Marcus was mostly likely not exposed to
                        Seneca, another one of the three most prominent Stoics.
                        <hr />
                        What is tragic about Marcus, as one scholar wrote, is
                        how his “philosophy—which is about self-restraint, duty,
                        and respect for others—was so abjectly abandoned by the
                        imperial line he anointed on his death.”

                              While on a campaign between 170 and 180, Marcus wrote his <strong>Meditations</strong> in Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. The original title of this work, if it had one, is unknown. 'Meditations' – as well as other titles including 'To Himself' – were adopted later. He had a logical mind and his notes were representative of Stoic philosophy and spirituality. Meditations is still revered as a literary monument to a government of service and duty. According to Gregory Hays, the book was a favorite of Christina of Sweden, Frederick the Great, John Stuart Mill, Matthew Arnold, and Goethe, and is admired by modern figures such as Wen Jiabao. It has been considered by many commentators to be one of the greatest works of philosophy.

                                  <strong>Meditations</strong> is the definitive text on self-discipline, personal ethics, humility, self-actualization, and strength. It proved to be equally inspirational to writers like Ambrose Bierce and Robert Louis Stevenson as he has been for statesmen like Theodore Roosevelt, Wen Jiabao. If you read it and aren’t profoundly changed by it, it’s probably because as Aurelius says “what doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.” John Stuart Mill considers Meditations as “the highest ethical product of the ancient mind”. <hr>
                                  It is important to remind ourselves that we are lucky to have access to these. As Gregory Hays explains, for centuries traces of it was lost until the beginning of the 10th century, “it reappears in a letter from the scholar and churchman Arethas.”

                              A brief synopsis and definition on this particular school of Hellenistic philosophy: <strong>Stoicism</strong> was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was famously practiced by the likes of Epictetus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. The philosophy asserts that virtue (such as wisdom) is happiness and judgment should be based on behavior, rather than words. That we don’t control and cannot rely on external events, only ourselves and our responses. <hr>Stoicism has just a few central teachings. It sets out to remind us of how unpredictable the world can be. How brief our moment of life is. How to be steadfast, and strong, and in control of yourself. And finally, that the source of our dissatisfaction lies in our impulsive dependency on our reflexive senses rather than logic. <hr>Stoicism doesn’t concern itself with complicated theories about the world, but with helping us overcome destructive emotions and act on what can be acted upon. It’s built for action, not endless debate. <hr>It had three principal leaders. Marcus Aurelius, the emperor of the Roman Empire, the most powerful man on earth, sat down each day to write himself notes about restraint, compassion and humility. Epictetus endured the horrors of slavery to found his own school where he taught many of Rome’s greatest minds. Seneca, when Nero turned on him and demanded his suicide, could think only of comforting his wife and friends. But it is not only those three—Stoicism has been practiced by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs. Both historical and modern men illustrate Stoicism as a way of life. <hr> Stoicism differs from most existing schools in one important sense: its purpose is practical application. It is not a purely intellectual enterprise. It’s a tool that we can use to become better in our craft, better friends and better people. <hr>The Stoics were writing honestly, often self-critically, about how they could become better people, be happier, and deal with the problems they faced. You can see how practicing misfortune makes you stronger in the face of adversity; how flipping an obstacle upside down turns problems into opportunities; and how remembering how small you are keeps your ego manageable and in perspective. <hr> Ultimately, that’s what Stoicism is about. It’s not some systematic discussion of why or how the world exists. It is a series of reminders, tips and aids for living a good life. Stoicism, as Marcus reminds himself, is not some grand Instructor but a balm, a soothing ointment to an injury wherever we might have one. Epictetus was right when he said that “life is hard, brutal, punishing, narrow, and confining, a deadly business.” <hr>We should take whatever help we can get, and it just happens that that help can come from ourselves.
